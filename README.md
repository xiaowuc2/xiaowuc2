  <h3 align="center">Machine Learning | Computer Vision</h3>
</p>

<p align="center">

I am currently in my third year pursuing Bachelors of Technology in Computer Science CGPA 9.43. I found Machine Learning and Computer Vision really intriguing because it gives computers the ability to think and see. So my endeavor is to go forward with it. I've experience in both industry research and academic research in the field of Applied Machine Learning and Computer Vision.

### Experience 
  
* #### Industrial Research
  * I've joined [@omdena](https://omdena.com) `New York` as Junior ML Engineer. Here I'll be working on `Helping the Energy Industry Achieve Digital Transformation Through AI` project with 50 collaborators to help to automatize site schemas in the energy industry building through Computer Vision.
  
  * I'm working in @NLP AI Automation as Machine Learning Researcher (Intern) with a team consist of IIT alumni. Where're I'm working on iris detection.

  * I'm the founder of a ML project based organization [@qxresearch](https://qxresearch.github.io), where we're working on research projects on Deep Learning with 150+ GitHub developers from all over the world.
  
 * #### Academic Research
  
    * Research Assistant at University of Engineering and Management, Kolkata. Working on Deep Learning based projects under supervision of `Professor Sankhadeep Chaterjee`.
